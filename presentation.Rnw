  %%% Introduction
  \begin{frame}{Sounds cool\ldots but what is it?}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What proportion will ``survive'' past a certain time?
      % Event History Analysis (sociology):
      %   Which kind of strikes last more than 3 days?
      \item Of those that ``survive,'' what is their failure or death rate?
      % Reliability Analysis (engineering):
      %   How long do different types of F1 tyres last?
      \item What factors affect how individuals ``survive''?
      % Duration Modeling (economics):
      %   How do different factors affect unemployment duration?
    \end{itemize}
    
    % also: political careers, earthquakes, medical,

  \begin{frame}{How did this magic happen?}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Analyze actuarial data
      % for mortality tables, very informal
      \item Became a discipline in WWII
      % interest reliability of equipment
      % spurred on by spike in demands for reliability, quality
      \item Medical field drove much of survival analysis
      % b/c studies do not need all subjects at the start of the study (async)
      %   ...handles subjects that quit, cannot follow-up, or die of different event
      %   (handles incomplete data)
      \item Kicked off with Kaplan-Meier estimator
      % http://www.jehps.net/juin2009/Aalenetal.pdf
      % raises new questions: how to compare survival curves?
      % prop hazards resolved covariates problem
      % application was ahead of theory, didn't know why things worked
